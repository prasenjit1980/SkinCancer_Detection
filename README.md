## General Information
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 2.0.3
- NumPy - version 1.24.3
- Seaborn - version 0.12.2
- MatplotLib - version 3.7.2
- Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4

## Conclusions
- On analysing data, it was observed that, the linear regression model was able to predict bike demand precisely with an R2 Score of nearly 80%

- Comparision between Training and Testing dataset:
  
  Train dataset R^2 : 0.828
  
  Test dataset R^2 : 0.79
